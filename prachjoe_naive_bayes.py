    # TODO COMMENT: Look up what the astype() method is doing and add a comment, explaining in your own words,
    # what the next two lines are doing.

    # and add a comment, explaining in your own words, what the next three lines are doing.
    
    # The TfidfVectorizer() method transforms a collection of your corpus, or text documents, to a matrix of TF-IDF
    # features, and it seems to accept what type of ngram as a parameter (in our case, unigram and bigram).
    # The fit_transform() method learns the vocabulary and idf of a corpus and returns a document-term matrix, and 
    # takes in a collection of raw documents as a parameter, in our case the reviews from the train dataset.
    # The transform() method, similar to fit_transform() method, transforms documents to document-term matrix, but it
    # does not learn the vocaublary and idf, and it takes in a collection of raw documents as a parameter, which in our
    # case would be the reviews from the test dataset.

    # Add a brief comment, trying to explain, in your own words, what smoothing is for.
    
    # The MultinomialNB() method is used for classification with discrete features and requires
    # integer feature counts or frantional counts like TF-IDF. This method accepts an "alpha" parameter,
    # which we set it equal to 1, meaning that it is an addtiive Laplace smoothing parameter.
    clf = MultinomialNB(alpha=ALPHA)

    # TODO COMMENT: Add a comment explaining in your own words what the "fit" method is doing.
    
    # The fit() method learns the vocabulary and IDF from a training set, which takes in a collection of
    # raw documents and an integer feature counts as a parameter, which in our case our the reviews and 
    # the labels for them in our training dataset, respectively.
    clf.fit(tf_idf_train, y_train)

    # TODO COMMENT: Add a comment explaining in your own words what the "predict" method is doing in the next two lines.

    # The predict() method predicts the labels of the data, based on the training model you used and takes in a collection
    # of raw documents as a parameter, which in our case are the reviews from both the training and testing dataset. This 
    # means that this method will predict the labels from both the training and the testing documents.

    # e.g. list(y_train) -- when passing them to your accuracy and precision and recall functions.
